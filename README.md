ExpressJS is one of the most popular and widely used web frameworks in the Node.js development zone. ExpressJS allows you to handle Routes, Server and I/O stuff very easily.  ExpressJS provides a smooth transition for legacy websites to use Node.js as their middle layer. So, if you have a website running on Apache or Nginx, then without much change in source code you can convert them into super fast ExpressJS website.

use **npm start** to start the server
